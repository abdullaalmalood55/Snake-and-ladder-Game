      <h2>Game Rules</h2>
      <p>
        This game contains a board that is numbered from 1 to 100 and the
        player's first one to reach number 100 will be considered as winner.
        Each player will have its turn to roll a dice that contains values
        numbered 1 to 6 and the based on that dice value, the player will make a
        movement from its position to a new position. There is also a bonus for
        the player who's dice stop at number 6. He will make 6 forward movements
        and then he will get another chance to roll the dice to move to newer
        position. The game will be easier for the player who stop at a position
        that is bottom of a ladder because the ladder will take him up and he
        will be skipping some rows of the board making him more closer to
        position 100. However, If player is unlucky at and stopped at a position
        that is a head of the snake, then he will be taken down to the position
        that is the tail of the snake and he will be losing his position that he
        struggled to reach it and he might being taken down falling from many
        high rows.
