# Snake-and-ladder-Game
I will be building a board starting from start point to end point and players will be represented by a circle or a symbol. The game rule is that a dice is rolled and player will make movements to as number of steps as he find the rolled dice. If he is a lucky he might climb a ladder saves him steps. If he is unlucky a snake will lose him steps.
<br/>1. There will be 2 to 4 players playing this game. Each Player is diffrentiated from the other player with distinguished from other player with a different color.
<br/>2. There will be a board containing startpoint and endpoint and each player will waits its turn and when its turn comes a dice will be rollen and what number it stops in, the player will make a movement and will move some steps.
<br/>3. If a dice stops at six, the player who its his turn will move six steps and will have a chance to make the dice roll again. 
<br/>4. A player might have a bonuses as well as same obstrucles. In some square points there will be ladders. If the player stops at the first step of the ladder, he will climb the ladder and skip some steps. 
<br/>However if a player stops at a snake face symbol, he will be eaten and fall down some steps and he will have to make movements again to be keep up with his last progress and reaches to end point.
<br/>5. If a player have made to the steps before the endpoint, the dice that rolls and his turn should stop at exact same number that will take you to endpoint to less or the dice will not move the player any further steps. 
<br/>-For example let say that the board contain 100 steps or points and the player reached point 96. He will have 4 steps to reach to endpoint so if the dice stops at 4 or less he will move but if the dice stops at 5 or 6 he will not move.
