#### **Game Rules**
- Each player have its turn to roll the rice and make movements from a position to other based on the dice value and the first player to reach 100 will be considered as winner. The higher value a player gets from a roll, the more positions he will be passing making hom closer to the win the game.

- Snakes are traps and obstacles. A player who stops at a position that contains a head of the snake, will be thrown down to the tail of the snake making the player to lose his position and be farther from winning.

- If a player passes position 95 and in his turn the dice stops at value more than he need, then he will not make a movement and the next player will have his turn unless he gets 6, he will be given a retry to roll the dice again and seek his chance.
